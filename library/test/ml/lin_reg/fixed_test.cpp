//! @todo Add test cases for the linear regression model here!

//! @note When comparing floating-point values, use EXPECT_NEAR(x, y, <tolerance>) to allow for 
//! small numerical differences. 
//! For example, to check that x is within ±1e-6 of y, write EXPECT_NEAR(x, y, 1e-6).

//! @todo Add a "happy path" test that verifies the model behaves correctly when given ideal input data.
//! This test should confirm that training and prediction work as expected when all arguments are 
//! valid and noise-free.

//! @todo Add tests to verify that the model does not get trained if any input argument is invalid, 
//! e.g., if the number of complete training sets is 0, the epoch count is 0, or the learning rate 
//! is less than or equal to 0. Also verify that the model always predicts 0 when untrained.
